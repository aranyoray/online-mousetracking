                        <b>Purpose:</b><br>
                        Hello. We are conducting a research study to examine how judge the ability of agents. You must be 18 years of
                        age or older to participate in this study.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <b>Brief description:</b><br>
                        In this study, you will complete a short categorization task. Then you will reflect on how you feel and answer
                        some questions. The estimated time to complete this study is approximately 3 minutes and you’ll receive $.84 in
                        exchange for participating.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <b>Procedures:</b><br>

                        <b>Risks and Benefits:</b><br>
                        There are no known or anticipated risks to you for participating. Although this study will not benefit you
                        personally, we hope that our results will add to the knowledge about social perception and learning.                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <b>Confidentiality:</b><br>

research oversight will have access to the information you provide in our Qualtrics survey system and password

information in connection with your ID. You will be paid through Prolific as usual using the submission code
and approval system.
